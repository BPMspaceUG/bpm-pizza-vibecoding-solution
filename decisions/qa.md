## 2026-07-31 — Greeting language source

**Q:** SPEC requires greeting in the pizzeria-country language; the live API
exposes no country field; DE/EN only; nothing hardcoded, config from env.
Which mechanism: (a) optional env `PIZZERIA_LANG` default de, (b) required
env var failing at startup, (c) constant in source, (d) other?

**A (decision):** **(b)** — `PIZZERIA_LANG` (de|en) is a required env var.
A default would smuggle in a hardcoded fallback, conflicting with "nothing
is hardcoded" and the missing-var-fails-startup rule. If missing/empty, exit
before the first turn naming `PIZZERIA_LANG` and where it was expected; no
default applied.
